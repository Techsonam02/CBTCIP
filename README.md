Iris Flower Classification
This repository contains code and resources for classifying Iris flower species using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its measurements: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. This project uses a Logistic Regression model to classify the Iris flower species.

Key objectives include: Data analysis and visualization.Feature engineering and preprocessing.Model training and evaluation.Insights and conclusions from the model.

The dataset contains 150 samples of Iris flowers, with 50 samples for each of three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. Each sample includes four features:Sepal length (cm)Sepal width (cm)Petal length (cm)Petal width (cm).

Requirements: Python ,NumPy,Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn,Scikit-learn,Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running and modifying notebooks)

Conclusions:
The project successfully demonstrates the application of Logistic Regression in classifying Iris species. The model's performance and key insights provide a strong foundation for further exploration and application of machine learning techniques to similar classification problems.
